  # How should we mount NFS?

  # This (using systemd.mount) fails sometimes, because network isn't ready yet:
  # fileSystems."/home" = {
  #   device = "nfs:/export/home";
  #   fsType = "nfs4";
  #   options = [
  #     "nofail"
  #     "timeo=14"
  #   ];
  # };
  # That is likely, because systemd-networkd-wait-online.target cannot determine, when we can start mounting nfs: Sometimes, additional links used for experimentation come online faster than the uplink, other times, other links do not come up at all. If we tracked manually, which link is the uplink/link for nfs, we could wait specifically for that link. But i don't want to do that manual labor. 
  # Instead we just add a retry to the NFS mount. However:
  # Neither NFS nor systemd.mount has an option for retries. See https://github.com/systemd/systemd/issues/4468
