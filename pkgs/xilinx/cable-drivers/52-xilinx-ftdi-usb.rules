 #  This file contains the rules used by UDEV when creating entries for    #
 #  Xilinx USB devices. In order for Xilinx's shared libraries and         #
 #  applications to access these devices without root privalages it is     #
 #  necessary for UDEV to create entries for which all users have read     #
 #  and write permission.                                                  #
 #                                                                         #
 #  Usage:                                                                 #
 #                                                                         #
 #  Copy this file to "/etc/udev/rules.d/" and execute                     #
 #  "/sbin/udevcontrol reload_rules" as root. This only needs to be done   #
 #  immediately after installation. Each time you reboot your system the   #
 #  rules are automatically loaded by UDEV.                                #

 # Create "/dev" entries for Xilinx device's with read and write
 # permission granted to all users.
 ACTION=="add", ATTR{idVendor}=="0403", ATTR{manufacturer}=="Xilinx", MODE:="666"

 # The following rules (if present) cause UDEV to ignore all UEVENTS for
 # which the subsystem is "usb_endpoint" and the action is "add" or
 # "remove". These rules are necessary to work around what appears to be a
 # bug in the Kernel used by Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6/CentOS 5. The Kernel
 # sends UEVENTS to remove and then add entries for the endpoints of a USB
 # device in "/dev" each time a process releases an interface. This occurs
 # each time a data transaction occurs. When an FPGA is configured or flash
 # device is written a large number of transactions take place. If the
 # following lines are commented out then UDEV will be overloaded for a long
 # period of time while it tries to process the massive number of UEVENTS it
 # receives from the kernel. Please note that this work around only applies
 # to systems running RHEL6 or CentOS 5 and as a result the rules will only
 # be present on those systems.
